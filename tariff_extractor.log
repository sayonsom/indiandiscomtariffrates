You tried to access openai.ChatCompletion, but this is no longer supported in openai>=1.0.0 - see the README at https://github.com/openai/openai-python for the API.

You can run `openai migrate` to automatically upgrade your codebase to use the 1.0.0 interface. 

Alternatively, you can pin your installation to the old version, e.g. `pip install openai==0.28`

A detailed migration guide is available here: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742

Further, \nHT VI Group Housing Society Tariff is also applicable for such Housing Colonies of \nindustrial consumers or educational institutions, taking supply at HT with separate  sub-\nmeter, irrespective of whether metering is at HT side or LT side of the transformer so \nlong as the supply is at HT voltage.  HT VI Group Housing Society tariff is not applicable \nto Co-op Housing Societies. \n \n12. \nTariff to Commercial Load of Industrial Consumers or Educational \nInstitute: \n \nFor commercial load (other than ancillary and incidental activities mentioned in \nSr.NO.10(e) above) of industrial  consumers or educational institutions taking supply at \nHT voltage with separate sub-meter, the HT II Commercial category Tariff will be \napplicable, irrespective of whether metering is at HT side or LT side of the transformer. \nThe HT VI Commercial category Tariff will not be applicable in such cases, since the \nsame was intended to be only an interim solution, since all such commercial category \n \n \n6 \nconsumers taking supply at single point have to be converted either to franchisee or \nindividual connections, in accordance with the detailed rationale given by the Commission \nin previous Tariff Orders. This provision needs to be implemented scrupulously.  \n \n13. \nRLC Refund Methodology: \n \nThe Commission has considered RLC refund amount of Rs. 666 Crs for FY 2012-13, out \nof which Rs. 500 Crs is to be refunded to live consumers and Rs. 166 Crs is to be \nrefunded to permanently disconnected consumers.   \n \nSince Rs. 500 Crs is to be refunded in FY 2012-13 out of the total RLC collection of Rs.  \n3227 Crs, the refund in FY 2012-13 will be in the same proportion of the contribution by \nthat consumer. The percentage of refund works out to 16%. \n \nThis will also ensure that consumers will get the refund in the exact same proportion as \ntheir contribution, and consumers those who have paid RLC for a lower duration, would \nget lower refund on a monthly basis, such that all the consumers get their complete \nrefund over the same period of time. \n \nRegarding methodology of RLC refund to PD consumers, the detail procedure will be \ninformed separately \n \n14. \nIncrease in Fixed/Demand Charges: \n \nThe Commission has partially increased Fixed Charges/Demand Charges for all \ncategories.  \n \nThe Demand Charges for the respective periods as per existing  Tariff  and  revised  \nTariffs shall  be  calculated  based  on  the  pro-rata basis  (Recorded Demand during  \nrespective period  divided by 30 days multiplied by number of days in the respective \nperiod falling under the billing cycle). \n \n15. \nInfrastructure Charge for Consumers in Nagpur: \n \nThe Commission has allowed MSEDCL to collect an additional charge of 9 paise per unit \nof consumption from the consumers in the O & M Divisions of MSEDCL at                \nMahal, Gandhibaug, Congress Nagar & Civil Lines under Nagpur Urban Circle towards \nexpenditure being incurred for executing the work of shifting of electric poles / lines \npresently causing obstacle to vehicular traffic in the city of Nagpur. \n \n \n \n7 \nThis additional charges shall not be considered for Electricity Duty, Penalty, Incentive and \nSubsidy.

Further, \n\nHT VI Group Housing Society Tariff is also applicable for such Housing Colonies of \n\nindustrial consumers or educational institutions, taking supply at HT with separate  sub-\n\nmeter, irrespective of whether metering is at HT side or LT side of the transformer so \n\nlong as the supply is at HT voltage.  HT VI Group Housing Society tariff is not applicable \n\nto Co-op Housing Societies. \n\n \n\n12. \nTariff to Commercial Load of Industrial Consumers or Educational \n\nInstitute: \n\n \nFor commercial load (other than ancillary and incidental activities mentioned in \n\nSr.NO.10(e) above) of industrial  consumers or educational institutions taking supply at \n\nHT voltage with separate sub-meter, the HT II Commercial category Tariff will be \n\napplicable, irrespective of whether metering is at HT side or LT side of the transformer. \n\nThe HT VI Commercial category Tariff will not be applicable in such cases, since the \n\nsame was intended to be only an interim solution, since all such commercial category \n\n \n \n6 \n\nconsumers taking supply at single point have to be converted either to franchisee or \n\nindividual connections, in accordance with the detailed rationale given by the Commission \n\nin previous Tariff Orders. This provision needs to be implemented scrupulously.  \n\n \n\n13. \nRLC Refund Methodology: \n\n \nThe Commission has considered RLC refund amount of Rs. 666 Crs for FY 2012-13, out \n\nof which Rs. 500 Crs is to be refunded to live consumers and Rs. 166 Crs is to be \n\nrefunded to permanently disconnected consumers.   \n\n \nSince Rs. 500 Crs is to be refunded in FY 2012-13 out of the total RLC collection of Rs.  \n\n3227 Crs, the refund in FY 2012-13 will be in the same proportion of the contribution by \n\nthat consumer. The percentage of refund works out to 16%. \n\n \n\nThis will also ensure that consumers will get the refund in the exact same proportion as \n\ntheir contribution, and consumers those who have paid RLC for a lower duration, would \n\nget lower refund on a monthly basis, such that all the consumers get their complete \n\nrefund over the same period of time. \n\n \nRegarding methodology of RLC refund to PD consumers, the detail procedure will be \n\ninformed separately \n\n \n\n14. \nIncrease in Fixed/Demand Charges: \n\n \nThe Commission has partially increased Fixed Charges/Demand Charges for all \n\ncategories.  \n\n \nThe Demand Charges for the respective periods as per existing  Tariff  and  revised  \n\nTariffs shall  be  calculated  based  on  the  pro-rata basis  (Recorded Demand during  \n\nrespective period  divided by 30 days multiplied by number of days in the respective \n\nperiod falling under the billing cycle). \n\n \n\n15. \nInfrastructure Charge for Consumers in Nagpur: \n\n \nThe Commission has allowed MSEDCL to collect an additional charge of 9 paise per unit \n\nof consumption from the consumers in the O & M Divisions of MSEDCL at                \n\nMahal, Gandhibaug, Congress Nagar & Civil Lines under Nagpur Urban Circle towards \n\nexpenditure being incurred for executing the work of shifting of electric poles / lines \n\npresently causing obstacle to vehicular traffic in the city of Nagpur. \n\n \n\n \n \n7 \n\nThis additional charges shall not be considered for Electricity Duty, Penalty, Incentive and \n\nSubsidy. This additional charge of 9 paise per unit shall be shown separately in the \n\nenergy bill till further order. \n\n \n16. \nDelayed Payment Charges (DPC): \n\n \nIn case the electricity bills are not paid within the due date mentioned on the bill, \n\ndelayed payment charges of 2 percent on the total electricity bill (including Taxes and \n\nDuties) shall be levied on the bill amount. However, if a consumer makes part \n\npayment of a bill within the due date, then the delayed payment charges shall \n\nbe applicable only on the amount which was not paid within the due date. For \n\nthe purpose of computation of time limit for payment of bills, “the day of \n\npresentation of bill” or “the date of the bill” or "the date of issue of the bill", \n\netc. as the case may be, will not be excluded. \n\n \n17. \nInterest on Consumer’s Security Deposit: \n\n \n\n \nThe Commission has directed MSEDCL to pay an interest rate of 9.5% on the consumer’s \n\nsecurity deposit for FY 2012-13. \n\n \n18. \nAdministrative Charges for Cheque Bouncing: \n\n \nThe Commission has approved the Administrative charges for cheque bouncing of Rs. \n\n350/- irrespective of cheque amount towards compensation of bank charges and \n\nMSEDCL’s administrative charges. \n\n \n\n19. \nOTHER PROVISIONS: \n\n \ni) \nThe rebates/incentives and disincentives have been retained at the existing levels. \n\n \nii) The Billing Demand definition has been retained as it is. \n\n \niii) Load Factor Incentive is also applicable to newly created HT IX Public Service \n\ncategory. \n\n \n\nACTION PLAN:- \n\n \nFor proper implementation of the revised Tariff Order, all the IT departments / field officers  \n\nshall follow guidelines given below:-  \n\n \n1. \nThe revised tariffs are to be applied from 1st August, 2012 till further Tariff \n\nOrder. \n\n2. \nThe Commission has approved the HT and LT tariff as indicated in booklets \n\n(Annexure “A”) effective from 01/08/2012.

Further, \n\nHT VI Group Housing Society Tariff is also applicable for such Housing Colonies of \n\nindustrial consumers or educational institutions, taking supply at HT with separate  sub-\n\nmeter, irrespective of whether metering is at HT side or LT side of the transformer so \n\nlong as the supply is at HT voltage.

This provision needs to be implemented scrupulously.  \n\n \n\n13. \nRLC Refund Methodology: \n\n \nThe Commission has considered RLC refund amount of Rs. 666 Crs for FY 2012-13, out \n\nof which Rs. 500 Crs is to be refunded to live consumers and Rs. 166 Crs is to be \n\nrefunded to permanently disconnected consumers.   \n\n \nSince Rs. 500 Crs is to be refunded in FY 2012-13 out of the total RLC collection of Rs.  \n\n3227 Crs, the refund in FY 2012-13 will be in the same proportion of the contribution by \n\nthat consumer. The percentage of refund works out to 16%. \n\n \n\nThis will also ensure that consumers will get the refund in the exact same proportion as \n\ntheir contribution, and consumers those who have paid RLC for a lower duration, would \n\nget lower refund on a monthly basis, such that all the consumers get their complete \n\nrefund over the same period of time. \n\n \nRegarding methodology of RLC refund to PD consumers, the detail procedure will be \n\ninformed separately \n\n \n\n14. \nIncrease in Fixed/Demand Charges: \n\n \nThe Commission has partially increased Fixed Charges/Demand Charges for all \n\ncategories.  \n\n \nThe Demand Charges for the respective periods as per existing  Tariff  and  revised  \n\nTariffs shall  be  calculated  based  on  the  pro-rata basis  (Recorded Demand during  \n\nrespective period  divided by 30 days multiplied by number of days in the respective \n\nperiod falling under the billing cycle). \n\n \n\n15. \nInfrastructure Charge for Consumers in Nagpur: \n\n \nThe Commission has allowed MSEDCL to collect an additional charge of 9 paise per unit \n\nof consumption from the consumers in the O & M Divisions of MSEDCL at                \n\nMahal, Gandhibaug, Congress Nagar & Civil Lines under Nagpur Urban Circle towards \n\nexpenditure being incurred for executing the work of shifting of electric poles / lines \n\npresently causing obstacle to vehicular traffic in the city of Nagpur. \n\n \n\n \n \n7 \n\nThis additional charges shall not be considered for Electricity Duty, Penalty, Incentive and \n\nSubsidy. This additional charge of 9 paise per unit shall be shown separately in the \n\nenergy bill till further order. \n\n \n16. \nDelayed Payment Charges (DPC): \n\n \nIn case the electricity bills are not paid within the due date mentioned on the bill, \n\ndelayed payment charges of 2 percent on the total electricity bill (including Taxes and \n\nDuties) shall be levied on the bill amount. However, if a consumer makes part \n\npayment of a bill within the due date, then the delayed payment charges shall \n\nbe applicable only on the amount which was not paid within the due date. For \n\nthe purpose of computation of time limit for payment of bills, “the day of \n\npresentation of bill” or “the date of the bill” or "the date of issue of the bill", \n\netc. as the case may be, will not be excluded. \n\n \n17. \nInterest on Consumer’s Security Deposit: \n\n \n\n \nThe Commission has directed MSEDCL to pay an interest rate of 9.5% on the consumer’s \n\nsecurity deposit for FY 2012-13. \n\n \n18. \nAdministrative Charges for Cheque Bouncing: \n\n \nThe Commission has approved the Administrative charges for cheque bouncing of Rs. \n\n350/- irrespective of cheque amount towards compensation of bank charges and \n\nMSEDCL’s administrative charges. \n\n \n\n19. \nOTHER PROVISIONS: \n\n \ni) \nThe rebates/incentives and disincentives have been retained at the existing levels. \n\n \nii) The Billing Demand definition has been retained as it is. \n\n \niii) Load Factor Incentive is also applicable to newly created HT IX Public Service \n\ncategory. \n\n \n\nACTION PLAN:- \n\n \nFor proper implementation of the revised Tariff Order, all the IT departments / field officers  \n\nshall follow guidelines given below:-  \n\n \n1. \nThe revised tariffs are to be applied from 1st August, 2012 till further Tariff \n\nOrder. \n\n2. \nThe Commission has approved the HT and LT tariff as indicated in booklets \n\n(Annexure “A”) effective from 01/08/2012.

Further, \n\nHT VI Group Housing Society Tariff is also applicable for such Housing Colonies of \n\nindustrial consumers or educational institutions, taking supply at HT with separate  sub-\n\nmeter, irrespective of whether metering is at HT side or LT side of the transformer so \n\nlong as the supply is at HT voltage.

This provision needs to be implemented scrupulously.  \n\n \n\n13. \nRLC Refund Methodology: \n\n \nThe Commission has considered RLC refund amount of Rs. 666 Crs for FY 2012-13, out \n\nof which Rs. 500 Crs is to be refunded to live consumers and Rs. 166 Crs is to be \n\nrefunded to permanently disconnected consumers.   \n\n \nSince Rs. 500 Crs is to be refunded in FY 2012-13 out of the total RLC collection of Rs.  \n\n3227 Crs, the refund in FY 2012-13 will be in the same proportion of the contribution by \n\nthat consumer. The percentage of refund works out to 16%. \n\n \n\nThis will also ensure that consumers will get the refund in the exact same proportion as \n\ntheir contribution, and consumers those who have paid RLC for a lower duration, would \n\nget lower refund on a monthly basis, such that all the consumers get their complete \n\nrefund over the same period of time. \n\n \nRegarding methodology of RLC refund to PD consumers, the detail procedure will be \n\ninformed separately \n\n \n\n14. \nIncrease in Fixed/Demand Charges: \n\n \nThe Commission has partially increased Fixed Charges/Demand Charges for all \n\ncategories.  \n\n \nThe Demand Charges for the respective periods as per existing  Tariff  and  revised  \n\nTariffs shall  be  calculated  based  on  the  pro-rata basis  (Recorded Demand during  \n\nrespective period  divided by 30 days multiplied by number of days in the respective \n\nperiod falling under the billing cycle). \n\n \n\n15. \nInfrastructure Charge for Consumers in Nagpur: \n\n \nThe Commission has allowed MSEDCL to collect an additional charge of 9 paise per unit \n\nof consumption from the consumers in the O & M Divisions of MSEDCL at                \n\nMahal, Gandhibaug, Congress Nagar & Civil Lines under Nagpur Urban Circle towards \n\nexpenditure being incurred for executing the work of shifting of electric poles / lines \n\npresently causing obstacle to vehicular traffic in the city of Nagpur. \n\n \n\n \n \n7 \n\nThis additional charges shall not be considered for Electricity Duty, Penalty, Incentive and \n\nSubsidy. This additional charge of 9 paise per unit shall be shown separately in the \n\nenergy bill till further order. \n\n \n16. \nDelayed Payment Charges (DPC): \n\n \nIn case the electricity bills are not paid within the due date mentioned on the bill, \n\ndelayed payment charges of 2 percent on the total electricity bill (including Taxes and \n\nDuties) shall be levied on the bill amount. However, if a consumer makes part \n\npayment of a bill within the due date, then the delayed payment charges shall \n\nbe applicable only on the amount which was not paid within the due date. For \n\nthe purpose of computation of time limit for payment of bills, “the day of \n\npresentation of bill” or “the date of the bill” or "the date of issue of the bill", \n\netc. as the case may be, will not be excluded. \n\n \n17. \nInterest on Consumer’s Security Deposit: \n\n \n\n \nThe Commission has directed MSEDCL to pay an interest rate of 9.5% on the consumer’s \n\nsecurity deposit for FY 2012-13. \n\n \n18. \nAdministrative Charges for Cheque Bouncing: \n\n \nThe Commission has approved the Administrative charges for cheque bouncing of Rs. \n\n350/- irrespective of cheque amount towards compensation of bank charges and \n\nMSEDCL’s administrative charges. \n\n \n\n19. \nOTHER PROVISIONS: \n\n \ni) \nThe rebates/incentives and disincentives have been retained at the existing levels. \n\n \nii) The Billing Demand definition has been retained as it is. \n\n \niii) Load Factor Incentive is also applicable to newly created HT IX Public Service \n\ncategory. \n\n \n\nACTION PLAN:- \n\n \nFor proper implementation of the revised Tariff Order, all the IT departments / field officers  \n\nshall follow guidelines given below:-  \n\n \n1. \nThe revised tariffs are to be applied from 1st August, 2012 till further Tariff \n\nOrder. \n\n2. \nThe Commission has approved the HT and LT tariff as indicated in booklets \n\n(Annexure “A”) effective from 01/08/2012.

In order to reduce the overall system T&D loss and to flatten the load curve by improving the existing system load factor of \n\nerstwhile DPL area, the HT consumers shall receive a voltage wise graded load factor rebate as per the following table: \n\nLOAD FACTOR REBATE (paise/ kWh) \n\nRange of Load Factor (LF) \nSupply Voltage \n\n11 kV \n33 kV \n132 kV \n\nAbove 55% \nUp to 60% \n1 \n2 \n3 \n\nAbove 60% \nUp to 65% \n2 \n3 \n4 \n\nAbove 65% \nUp to 70% \n3 \n4 \n5 \n\nAbove 70% \nUp to 75% \n10 \n11 \n12 \n\nAbove 75% \nUp to 80% \n12 \n13 \n14 \n\nAbove 80% \nUp to 85% \n14 \n15 \n16 \n\nAbove 85% \nUp to 90% \n16 \n17 \n18 \n\nAbove 90% \nUp to 92% \n18 \n19 \n20 \n\nAbove 92% \nUp to 95% \n22 \n24 \n25 \n\nAbove 95% \n25 \n27 \n28 \n\n\nRATE SCHEDULE TABLE:\nRange of Load Factor (LF) | None | Supply Voltage | None | None\nNone | None | 11 kV | 33 kV | 132 kV\nAbove 55% | Up to 60% | 1 | 2 | 3\nAbove 60% | Up to 65% | 2 | 3 | 4\nAbove 65% | Up to 70% | 3 | 4 | 5\nAbove 70% | Up to 75% | 10 | 11 | 12\nAbove 75% | Up to 80% | 12 | 13 | 14\nAbove 80% | Up to 85% | 14 | 15 | 16\nAbove 85% | Up to 90% | 16 | 17 | 18\nAbove 90% | Up to 92% | 18 | 19 | 20\nAbove 92% | Up to 95% | 22 | 24 | 25\nAbove 95% | None | 25 | 27 | 28\nPage 10 of 15 \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2. The  above  load  factor  rebate  shall  be  applicable  on  total  quantum  of  energy consumed  in  a  billing  period  (for  \n\nexample  one  11  KV  consumer  at  85%  load factor  shall be eligible for  a rebate @ 14 paise /  KWh on the total quantum of \n\nenergy consumed in a billing period). \n\n \n\n1.3. Load factor surcharge shall continue at the prevailing rate for those categories of consumers to whom these are applicable at \n\npresent. \n\n \n\n1.4. Load factor rebate and load factor surcharge shall be computed in accordance with the formula and associated principles given \n\nin regulations  3.9.2, 3.9.3 and 3.9.4 of the Tariff Regulations and at the rates mentioned above in paragraphs 1.1  and \n1.3 \n\nrespectively. \n\n2. Fixed I Demand Charge:  \n\n \n\n(a) \nThe fixed charge shall be applicable to different categories of consumers at the rates as shown in above tariff schedule. \n\n \n\n(b) \nThe demand charge shall be applicable to different categories of consumers as per rates as shown in above tariff schedule on \n\nthe basis of recorded demand as specified in regulation 4.3.3 of the Tariff Regulations subject to the conditions specified in the \n\nTariff Regulations. \n\n \n\n(c) \nWhen a new consumer gets connected to the system, the computation of fixed charge or demand charge for that month shall \n\nbe made pro-rata for the number of days of supply in that particular month. \n\n3.  Subject to the condition as specified in regulation 4.13 of the Tariff Regulations, the minimum charge shall continue at the existing level \n\nfor all consumers.  \n\n \n\n4. The applicable rate of temporary supply for a consumer during the year 2023-24 shall be the same rate at which he is being charged \n\nprior to issue of this order. \n\n \n\nPage 11 of 15 \n\n \n\n5. For all consumers, excluding consumers having pre-paid meters, rebate shall be given @ 1% of the amount of the bill excluding meter \n\nrent, taxes, duties, levies and arrears (not being the arrears due to revision of tariff) if the payment is made within the due date. \n\n  \n\n6.

Load Factor Rebate / Surcharge:  \n   \n  \n\n1.1. In order to reduce the overall system T&D loss and to flatten the load curve by improving the existing system load factor of \n\nWBSEDCL, the voltage-wise graded load factor rebate applicable for the EHV and HV industrial consumers and L&MV industrial \nconsumers of 50 kVA and above (B-IDI and B-IDIT) will be as per the following table:  \n\n \n\nLOAD FACTOR REBATE (paise/kWh) \n\nFor the Year 2023-24 \n\nRange of Load factor (LF) \nSupply Voltage \n\nBelow 33 kV \n33 kV \nAbove 33 kV \n\nAbove 70-upto 75 \n6 \n6 \n6 \n\nAbove 75-upto 80 \n11 \n11 \n11 \n\nAbove 80-upto 85 \n16 \n31 \n31 \n\nAbove 85-upto 90 \n21 \n36 \n36 \n\nAbove 90-upto92 \n26 \n41 \n41 \n\nAbove 92-upto 95 \n31 \n46 \n46 \n\nAbove 95 \n36 \n51 \n51 \n\n \n\n1.2. Further, an additional LF rebate for 33 KV & 132 KV industries under revenue enhancement scheme as approved in order dated \n\n08/02/2017 in Case No. OA-242/16-17 of the Commission shall continue. \n\n \n\n1.3. Load factor surcharge shall continue for those HV, EHV and L&MV (above 50 KVA) categories of consumers to whom those are \n\napplicable at present. The applicable rate of load factor surcharge for different voltage level for the year 2023-24 will be as per the \ntable below: \n\nLOAD FACTOR SURCHARGE (Paise/kWh) \n\nFor the Year 2023-24 \n\nRange of Load factor (LF) \nSupply Voltage \n\nBelow 33 kV \n33 kV \nAbove 33 kV \n\nAbove 0-upto 25 \n35 \n70 \n80 \n\nAbove 25-upto 30 \n15 \n50 \n60 \n\nAbove 30-upto 60 \n14 \n48 \n58 \n\nAbove 60-upto 65 \n7 \n41 \n50 \n\n \n\n1.4. The above load factor rebate and surcharge shall be applicable on total quantum of energy consumed in the billing period. Load \n\nfactor rebate and surcharge shall be computed in accordance with the formula and associated principles specified in regulations \n3.9.2, 3.9.3 and 3.9.4 of the Tariff Regulations. For availing load factor rebate the consumer has to make its payment within due \ndate.  \n\n\nRATE SCHEDULE TABLE:\n | None | None | None | None | For the Year 2023-2 | None | None | None | None | None | 4 | None | None | None | None | None | None | None | None | None\nRange of Load factor (LF) | None | None | None | None | None |  | None | None | None | None | Supply Voltage | None | None | None | None |  | None | None | None | None\n | None | None | None | None | None |  | Below 33 kV | None | None |  |  | 33 kV | None | None |  |  | Above 33 kV | None | None | \n | Above 70-upto 75 | None | None |  | None |  | None | 6 |  | None |  | None | 6 |  | None |  | None | 6 |  | None\n | Above 75-upto 80 | None | None |  | None |  | None | 11 |  | None |  | None | 11 |  | None |  | None | 11 |  | None\n | Above 80-upto 85 | None | None |  | None |  | None | 16 |  | None |  | None | 31 |  | None |  | None | 31 |  | None\n | Above 85-upto 90 | None | None |  | None |  | None | 21 |  | None |  | None | 36 |  | None |  | None | 36 |  | None\n | Above 90-upto92 | None | None |  | None |  | None | 26 |  | None |  | None | 41 |  | None |  | None | 41 |  | None\n | Above 92-upto 95 | None | None |  | None |  | None | 31 |  | None |  | None | 46 |  | None |  | None | 46 |  | None\n | None | Above 95 |  | None | None |  | None | 36 |  | None |  | None | 51 |  | None |  | None | 51 |  | None\n | None | None | For the Year 2023-24 | None | None | None | None | None | None |  | None | None | None | None | None | None | None | None | None | None\nRange of Load factor (LF) | None | None | None |  | None | None | None | None | Supply Voltage | None | None | None | None | None | None |  | None | None | None | None\n | None | None | None |  | Below 33 kV | None | None |  |  | None | 33 kV | None | None |  |  | None | Above 33 kV | None | None | \n | Above 0-upto 25 |  | None |  | None | 35 |  | None |  | None | None | 70 |  | None |  | None | None | 80 |  | None\n | Above 25-upto 30 |  | None |  | None | 15 |  | None |  | None | None | 50 |  | None |  | None | None | 60 |  | None\n | Above 30-upto 60 |  | None |  | None | 14 |  | None |  | None | None | 48 |  | None |  | None | None | 58 |  | None\n | Above 60-upto 65 |  | None |  | None | 7 |  | None |  | None | None | 41 |  | None |  | None | None | 50 |  | None\nPage 11 of 17 \n\n \n\n2. Fixed / Demand Charge:  \n\n \n\n(a) The fixed charge shall be applicable to different categories of consumers at the rates shown in Annexure 8B1 and Annexure 8B2 of \n\nthis tariff order. For agriculture consumers under L&MV category, fixed charge during July to October (Monsoon season) will be \n50% of the fixed charge specified in Annexure 8B2.  \n\n(b) The demand charge shall be applicable to different categories of consumers as per rates shown in Annexure 8B2 and Annexure \n\n8B3 of this order on the basis of recorded demand as specified in regulation 4.3.3 of the Tariff Regulations subject to the conditions \nspecified in the Tariff Regulations. \n\n(c) When a new consumer gets connected to the system, the computation of fixed charge or demand charge for that month shall be \n\nmade pro-rata for the number of days of supply in that particular month. \n \n\n3.

Load Factor Rebate / Surcharge:  \n   \n  \n\n1.1. In order to reduce the overall system T&D loss and to flatten the load curve by improving the existing system load factor of \n\nWBSEDCL, the voltage-wise graded load factor rebate applicable for the EHV and HV industrial consumers and L&MV industrial \nconsumers of 50 kVA and above (B-IDI and B-IDIT) will be as per the following table:  \n\n \n\nLOAD FACTOR REBATE (paise/kWh) \n\nFor the Year 2023-24 \n\nRange of Load factor (LF) \nSupply Voltage \n\nBelow 33 kV \n33 kV \nAbove 33 kV \n\nAbove 70-upto 75 \n6 \n6 \n6 \n\nAbove 75-upto 80 \n11 \n11 \n11 \n\nAbove 80-upto 85 \n16 \n31 \n31 \n\nAbove 85-upto 90 \n21 \n36 \n36 \n\nAbove 90-upto92 \n26 \n41 \n41 \n\nAbove 92-upto 95 \n31 \n46 \n46 \n\nAbove 95 \n36 \n51 \n51 \n\n \n\n1.2. Further, an additional LF rebate for 33 KV & 132 KV industries under revenue enhancement scheme as approved in order dated \n\n08/02/2017 in Case No. OA-242/16-17 of the Commission shall continue. \n\n \n\n1.3. Load factor surcharge shall continue for those HV, EHV and L&MV (above 50 KVA) categories of consumers to whom those are \n\napplicable at present. The applicable rate of load factor surcharge for different voltage level for the year 2023-24 will be as per the \ntable below: \n\nLOAD FACTOR SURCHARGE (Paise/kWh) \n\nFor the Year 2023-24 \n\nRange of Load factor (LF) \nSupply Voltage \n\nBelow 33 kV \n33 kV \nAbove 33 kV \n\nAbove 0-upto 25 \n35 \n70 \n80 \n\nAbove 25-upto 30 \n15 \n50 \n60 \n\nAbove 30-upto 60 \n14 \n48 \n58 \n\nAbove 60-upto 65 \n7 \n41 \n50 \n\n \n\n1.4. The above load factor rebate and surcharge shall be applicable on total quantum of energy consumed in the billing period. Load \n\nfactor rebate and surcharge shall be computed in accordance with the formula and associated principles specified in regulations \n3.9.2, 3.9.3 and 3.9.4 of the Tariff Regulations. For availing load factor rebate the consumer has to make its payment within due \ndate.  \n\n\nRATE SCHEDULE TABLE:\n | None | None | None | None | For the Year 2023-2 | None | None | None | None | None | 4 | None | None | None | None | None | None | None | None | None\nRange of Load factor (LF) | None | None | None | None | None |  | None | None | None | None | Supply Voltage | None | None | None | None |  | None | None | None | None\n | None | None | None | None | None |  | Below 33 kV | None | None |  |  | 33 kV | None | None |  |  | Above 33 kV | None | None | \n | Above 70-upto 75 | None | None |  | None |  | None | 6 |  | None |  | None | 6 |  | None |  | None | 6 |  | None\n | Above 75-upto 80 | None | None |  | None |  | None | 11 |  | None |  | None | 11 |  | None |  | None | 11 |  | None\n | Above 80-upto 85 | None | None |  | None |  | None | 16 |  | None |  | None | 31 |  | None |  | None | 31 |  | None\n | Above 85-upto 90 | None | None |  | None |  | None | 21 |  | None |  | None | 36 |  | None |  | None | 36 |  | None\n | Above 90-upto92 | None | None |  | None |  | None | 26 |  | None |  | None | 41 |  | None |  | None | 41 |  | None\n | Above 92-upto 95 | None | None |  | None |  | None | 31 |  | None |  | None | 46 |  | None |  | None | 46 |  | None\n | None | Above 95 |  | None | None |  | None | 36 |  | None |  | None | 51 |  | None |  | None | 51 |  | None\n | None | None | For the Year 2023-24 | None | None | None | None | None | None |  | None | None | None | None | None | None | None | None | None | None\nRange of Load factor (LF) | None | None | None |  | None | None | None | None | Supply Voltage | None | None | None | None | None | None |  | None | None | None | None\n | None | None | None |  | Below 33 kV | None | None |  |  | None | 33 kV | None | None |  |  | None | Above 33 kV | None | None | \n | Above 0-upto 25 |  | None |  | None | 35 |  | None |  | None | None | 70 |  | None |  | None | None | 80 |  | None\n | Above 25-upto 30 |  | None |  | None | 15 |  | None |  | None | None | 50 |  | None |  | None | None | 60 |  | None\n | Above 30-upto 60 |  | None |  | None | 14 |  | None |  | None | None | 48 |  | None |  | None | None | 58 |  | None\n | Above 60-upto 65 |  | None |  | None | 7 |  | None |  | None | None | 41 |  | None |  | None | None | 50 |  | None\nPage 11 of 17 \n\n \n\n2. Fixed / Demand Charge:  \n\n \n\n(a) The fixed charge shall be applicable to different categories of consumers at the rates shown in Annexure 8B1 and Annexure 8B2 of \n\nthis tariff order. For agriculture consumers under L&MV category, fixed charge during July to October (Monsoon season) will be \n50% of the fixed charge specified in Annexure 8B2.  \n\n(b) The demand charge shall be applicable to different categories of consumers as per rates shown in Annexure 8B2 and Annexure \n\n8B3 of this order on the basis of recorded demand as specified in regulation 4.3.3 of the Tariff Regulations subject to the conditions \nspecified in the Tariff Regulations. \n\n(c) When a new consumer gets connected to the system, the computation of fixed charge or demand charge for that month shall be \n\nmade pro-rata for the number of days of supply in that particular month. \n \n\n3.
