To provide you with the specifics on electricity rates for residential customers, including any EV (Electric Vehicle) and Time of Day tariffs, I would need additional details from the documents you uploaded. It seems that the document contains information related to electricity rights and amendments, so specifics might be found within certain sections regarding tariffs. Unfortunately, the search did not directly highlight the exact information on these tariffs.

Please specify which parts or sections might be relevant, or if you remember any particular page number or section heading, let me know, so I can locate the details accurately for you.
